# hodor

Give your coding agent fake credentials that work. hodor is a secure agent environment. Your agent holds only format-valid decoys and works exactly as before. The real secrets stay in fnox. hodor swaps a decoy for the real value transparently, only on hosts you allow, and swaps it back on the response. Protect your secrets without changing how you work.

A leaked prompt, a pasted log, or a dependency that phones home carries the decoy. The upstream rejects it everywhere except the grant. The real value appears on the wire only to a host you named.

One command drops you into that environment. `hodor agent` starts the stack and opens a shell in a container that holds only decoys. Every connection is captured transparently, so there is no proxy setting to find and no way around the proxy.

Underneath sits a grant-scoped proxy. A workload can also point its proxy settings at hodor, or hodor can capture its traffic with `--proxy-backend` (`tproxy`, `tun`, or `ebpf`). On a grant match hodor terminates TLS with a per-domain leaf signed by its own CA and swaps the decoy for the real value in headers, basic auth, and bodies, over HTTP/1 and HTTP/2. On the response it swaps real values back to decoys. Every other connection is spliced byte for byte with the real upstream certificate untouched.

## Install

**From a release** (Linux, amd64 and arm64), with the installer script:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
  https://github.com/casualjim/hodor/releases/latest/download/hodor-installer.sh | sh
```

**With mise**, which installs the release tarball for your platform:

```sh
mise use -g github:casualjim/hodor
```

Or download a tarball from [the releases page](https://github.com/casualjim/hodor/releases) and put `hodor` on your `PATH`.

**As a container**: `ghcr.io/casualjim/hodor`. The image is runtime-only, entrypoint `hodor`, default command `serve`.

```sh
docker run --rm ghcr.io/casualjim/hodor:latest fake GH_TOKEN
```

**From source**: clone, then build with a recent stable Rust toolchain (the crate uses edition 2024; all three Linux capture backends compile in unconditionally):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/casualjim/hodor
cd hodor
cargo build --release
```

The `ebpf` backend additionally needs a nightly toolchain (the BPF target has no prebuilt `core`, so `aya-build` uses `-Z build-std`) and [`bpf-linker`](https://github.com/aya-rs/bpf-linker) to link the programs; both are pinned in `mise.toml`, so `mise run build` provides them.

## Try it in 30 seconds

You need docker and your secrets in fnox. Install hodor, name your source directories once, then step into any workspace as a secure agent.

```sh
mise use -g github:casualjim/hodor
mkdir -p ~/.config/hodor
cat > ~/.config/hodor/config.toml <<'EOF'
[workspace]
# source directories you want beside your workspace
include = ["~/projects"]
EOF

cd ~/projects/my-awesome-thing
hodor agent
# do work, exit the agent
hodor down
```

Container home, shell, listener, and CA all default, so that file is the whole setup. `hodor agent` generates the stack, starts it, and drops you into the agent. The agent holds only decoys. Real values stay in fnox and reach only granted hosts. `hodor down` stops the devenv.

To see the raw credential swap from both sides of the wire, follow the [tutorial](docs/user/tutorial.md).

## The shape of a config

```toml
[rules.github_token]
env = "GITHUB_TOKEN"          # decoy seed, registry key, fnox key
allow = ["https://api.github.com"]
```

That file is the whole config. The listener defaults to `127.0.0.1:8080` and the CA to `/certs/ca.pem` when the stack mounted it there, else `<config-dir>/hodor/ca.pem`. Start the proxy, hand your agent its decoy, and the rule is live:

```sh
hodor serve
hodor fake GITHUB_TOKEN    # the value the agent holds
```

`env = "GITHUB_TOKEN"` alone is a complete rule when the bundled known-host registry knows the name: the registry supplies the hosts and the decoy shape, and [fnox](https://fnox.jdx.dev) supplies the real value at serve time (age, 1Password, Vault, Bitwarden, AWS Secrets Manager, the OS keychain, and the rest of its provider catalog; no fnox binary needed). Most workspaces state no rules at all: every fnox-declared name the registry knows becomes a rule at serve time, and config holds overrides only.

When the registry entry declares the service's OAuth2 flow, freshly issued tokens are covered too: the proxy rewrites the token endpoint's response so the agent holds a minted decoy, and swaps it back on every later request. `hodor registry from-oidc` / `from-openapi` turn a vendor's discovery or OpenAPI document into that entry.

## Documentation

Everything lives under [docs/user](docs/user/README.md), arranged by what you need:

- [Secure your workspace](docs/user/how-to/confine-a-workspace.md) — run a coding agent with decoys only. Start here.
- [Tutorial](docs/user/tutorial.md) — one credential swap through the raw proxy, end to end, both sides of the wire.
- How-to guides — [capture traffic transparently](docs/user/how-to/capture-traffic-transparently.md), [get values from fnox](docs/user/how-to/get-values-from-fnox.md), [extend the registry](docs/user/how-to/extend-the-registry.md), [trust the CA](docs/user/how-to/trust-the-ca.md).
- Reference — [CLI](docs/user/reference/cli.md), [configuration](docs/user/reference/configuration.md), [allow entries](docs/user/reference/allow-entries.md), [decoy patterns](docs/user/reference/decoy-patterns.md), [registry](docs/user/reference/registry.md).
- Explanation — [how hodor works](docs/user/explanation/how-it-works.md), [the security model](docs/user/explanation/security-model.md) (what it defends against and what it does not).

Two runnable examples ship in the repository:

- [examples/agentic-devenv](examples/agentic-devenv/README.md) — a workspace to secure with `hodor up`: one hodor container, one agent container holding only decoys, transparent capture, and real values that stay in fnox.
- [integration](integration/README.md) — the compose demo behind `mise run demo`, asserting four substitution scenarios and one splice scenario.

## Where the limits are

hodor matches the request authority, not the path. An agent that hashes or signs the credential before sending defeats substitution, and the upstream rejects the request. A `*` grant host matches any destination. A client must trust hodor's CA to reach a granted HTTPS host. Transparent capture needs root and Linux; the `tproxy` backend needs `CAP_NET_ADMIN`, the `tun` backend a TUN device, and the `ebpf` backend `CAP_BPF` + `CAP_NET_ADMIN`, kernel 5.15, and IPv4. [The security model](docs/user/explanation/security-model.md) states each of these with its consequence.
