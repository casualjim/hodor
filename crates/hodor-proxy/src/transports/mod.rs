//! Protocol transports. This root is protocol-blind: it holds the traits —
//! one per responsibility — the stream a transport is handed, and the
//! shared substitution engine. Each protocol vertical implements the
//! responsibilities it owns; the composition root (lib.rs) retains the
//! strategies, and the picker (identity.rs) routes one stream to one
//! strategy in one place.
